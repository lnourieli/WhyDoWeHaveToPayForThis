    <h1>Why do we have to pay for this?</h1>
    <h2>By Lia Nourieli</h2>
    <p>A parody of an MTA banner poster. I created this illustration with the official MTA aspect ratio in mind. I think it depicts the public transportation situation in NYC much more realistically than the posters displayed in the subway.</p>
